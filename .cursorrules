You are working in a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS personal site repo.

Before making ANY edits:
- Read `AGENTS.md`, `STATE.md`, and `DECISIONS.md`.

Hard constraints:
- No frontend frameworks (no React/Vue/Svelte/Angular).
- No bundlers required; the site must work by opening `index.html` directly.
- Do not add runtime JS dependencies for the website.
- Do not add analytics.
- Do not add new network calls.

Engineering constraints:
- Keep diffs minimal.
- No large refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer small, pure functions (especially for testable logic in `src/`).

Testing requirements:
- If you change JS logic (especially anything under `src/`), add/update tests under `tests/`.
- Run tests with `npm test` (Node 18+ `node:test`) and ensure they pass.

End-of-session requirements:
- Update `STATE.md` (structure + how to run).
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` (date + what changed + why).
- If you made a non-trivial decision (tooling/structure), add an entry to `DECISIONS.md`.
