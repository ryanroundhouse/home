## Agent change log

### Unreleased
- **2026-02-25**: Adjusted chatroom message behavior after feedback: the chat panel remains fixed-height/scrollable but now renders all loaded room messages (instead of only the last 10) so users can scroll back through history; added OS-aware shortcut labels (`Cmd`/`Option` on macOS, `Ctrl`/`Alt` elsewhere) while keeping the keyboard shortcuts working.
- **2026-02-25**: Refined chatroom UI behavior: the active chat pane now stays at a fixed height with internal scrolling, auto-scrolls on new messages only when the viewer is already near the bottom (prevents jitter), removes the WebSocket target blurb, moves “Reroll Avatar” beside the avatar preview, and caps the rooms list to ~6 visible entries with scrolling.
- **2026-02-22**: Added locally bundled chat notification WAVs (`assets/sounds/chat-ping.wav`, `assets/sounds/chat-gong.wav`) sourced from OpenGameArt and deployed with the site; `chat.js` now plays these files for message ping + mention gong (with synthesized tones kept as fallback).
- **2026-02-22**: Added a new `chat.html` page + `chat.js` chatroom UI (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS) with room creation/joining, per-room history display capped at 500 messages, no-auth profiles (name + random SVG avatar), `/emote` messages, timestamps, keyboard shortcuts, and ping/gong audio notifications.
- **2026-02-22**: Switched the chat frontend to a WebSocket-backed client targeting `wss://rgbot.graham.pub:8443` (auto-reconnect + heartbeat + protocol-driven rooms/history/messages) so it can work with a real multi-user backend.
- **2026-02-22**: Added `CHAT_BACKEND_WEBSOCKET_PROMPT.md` with a concrete backend build prompt and JSON protocol contract (rooms, joins, 500-message history, profile updates, message broadcast) so backend work can proceed in parallel.
- **2026-02-22**: Added `Chat` to the site navigation on all pages and taught the terminal `open` command / usage text about `open chat`.
- **2025-12-29**: Shrunk Pipes modal layout ~30% (dialog + tiles + spacing) while keeping font sizes unchanged.
- **2025-12-29**: Pipes minigame now randomizes the route/solution on each launch (still guaranteed solvable).
- **2025-12-29**: Reduced Shadow Party quest hand-holding by removing internal checkpoints (decrypt/salt+hash/weak-password) from TODO.md and removing the code that tracked them.
- **2025-12-29**: Tweaked Shadow Party: mindwarp birthday mail timestamp set to Dec 29 2025 @ 8:11am; Pipes win now shows a “WEAK PASSWORD FOUND” success stamp before returning to the terminal.
- **2025-12-28**: Added a new terminal mission “Shadow Party” (BBS thread → unlockable encrypted `shadow.snapshot` → `get hash-index` → `hash-index` launches a new Pipes minigame modal → vault password backfill → `ssh jsj@mindwarp.com` → `mail` birthday message). Includes a new simulated host `mindwarp.com` and new tests for unlockable files + hash-index installs.
- **2025-12-28**: Fixed `guidance.txt` in the simulated terminal filesystem: it showed up in `ls` but failed `cat` due to a mismatched seed key. Added regression tests, including a “seat-belt” that asserts all filesystem `contents` keys match `node.name` across hosts.
- **2025-12-25**: Added a Moodful link to `links.html` with a short description (daily mood tracking + analytics + insights).
- **2025-12-25**: Added **12 site-wide themes** inspired by popular terminal palettes, selectable via the new `themes` command in the in-browser terminal. Selection persists in localStorage and resets to the default dark theme on `rm -rf /`.
- **2025-12-25**: Terminal `open moodful.ca` now opens `https://moodful.ca` in a new tab.
- **2025-12-24**: Added `get` + installable binaries with a localStorage-backed `~/bin` overlay (per user@host). `get memcorrupt` installs `memcorrupt` with download-like output; `memcorrupt <pid>` now gates on the fantasy-football quest and launches the “Memory Injection” minigame on the correct service PID.
- **2025-12-24**: Implemented the “Memory Injection” minigame modal overlay (card matching under timer + CRT activity feed) plus a win cinematic that highlights a single-value diff (e.g. `66 → 69`) with a contracting reticle and animates injecting a patch into volatile memory. Successful injection is one-time per PID and persisted in localStorage.
- **2025-12-24**: Expanded the Neon-City BBS mission post into a short in-post “thread” (helpful but vague advice + parker confusion). After successful memory injection, a new “thanks” reply is appended to the BBS group; reading that follow-up completes the mission (moves it from TODO.md to DONE.md).
- **2025-12-24**: Added `ps` to the terminal. All hosts show your current `-bash` session; `fantasy-football-league.com` also shows a running webserver service with a stable PID for follow-on “memory corruption” commands.
- **2025-12-24**: Expanded `fantasy-football-league.com` with additional users + home directories and added a root-only `/fantasy-football-scores` folder with head-to-head matchup score files.
- **2025-12-24**: Terminal `cd`/`ls`/`cat` now enforce embedded UNIX-style `permissions` (with `root` bypass) via `lib/terminalPermissions.js`, plus new/updated tests.
- **2025-12-23**: Fixed terminal SSH state loss on refresh by persisting the ssh “return frame” in localStorage. `exit` and remote `reboot` now always restore `rg@arcade` even if the return frame was lost.
- **2025-12-23**: Added extra spacing when reading a BBS post (menu/subject/body) for readability.
- **2025-12-23**: BBS now disconnects after reading a post so the full message remains visible.
- **2025-12-23**: Fixed Neon-City BBS banner text (spelling).
- **2025-12-23**: Added `bbs` (Neon-City) to the terminal. Includes a seeded `neon.missions` group with one post, persistent read/unread state, vault credential capture from post content, and TODO.md quest activation on read.
- **2025-12-23**: Added simulated host `fantasy-football-league.com` for ssh (parker/sundaypaper) and a minimal host filesystem.
- **2025-12-23**: Made `~/vault.txt` a dynamic credentials ledger. Reading emails that contain `Host/User/Pass` stores credentials in localStorage and prints a “credentials stored” hint; `cat` of a decrypted `vault.txt` renders the stored credentials; `rm -rf /` wipes vault state.
- **2025-12-23**: Added vault module + tests (`lib/terminalVault.js`, `tests/terminalVault.test.js`).
- **2025-12-23**: Added encrypted files + `decrypt <file>` command. Encrypted files `cat` as corrupted ASCII until unlocked via a timing-bar minigame modal; successful decrypt persists in localStorage and `rm -rf /` now wipes decrypt state too.
- **2025-12-21**: Added simulated multi-host SSH to the in-browser terminal: `ssh <user>@<host>` prompts for password and switches filesystem/prompt; `exit` returns to the prior arcade directory. Includes test host `moodful.ca` (root/wow) and Node tests.
- **2025-12-21**: Added a one-time SSH milestone unlock: first successful `ssh root@moodful.ca` reveals a hidden `ops@moodful.ca` reboot request email in `rg@arcade`.
- **2025-12-22**: Added a simulated `reboot` command: counts down then closes the terminal on `arcade`, or drops you back to the prior session when run on an ssh host.
- **2025-12-22**: Linked Moodful actions into a quest: first `ssh root@moodful.ca` unlocks the reboot request email; reading it activates `/home/rg/TODO.md`; rebooting `moodful.ca` unlocks a thank-you email.
- **2025-12-22**: When a quest completes, it moves from `/home/rg/TODO.md` to `/home/rg/DONE.md`.
- **2025-12-22**: Added a simulated `rm -rf /` reset command (with confirmation) to wipe all local terminal state and restart the adventure from scratch.
- **2025-12-21**: Added a simulated old-school `mail` command with per-`user@host` inboxes, persistent read/unread/hidden flags in localStorage, a consolidated mail catalog (`lib/terminalMailData.js`), and mission-style unlocking via `unlockKey` (unhide by key).
- **2025-12-21**: Extracted filesystem data and operations from `terminal.js` into `lib/terminalFilesystem.js` for better modularity. Moved `filesystemData`, `getNode()`, and `getDirectoryContents()` into the new module.
- **2025-12-21**: Added agent docs (`AGENTS.md`, `STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`) and change log template.
- **2025-12-21**: Added `.cursorrules` and a minimal Node test harness (`package.json`, `src/`, `tests/`) using `node:test` (no extra packages).
- **2025-12-21**: Pinned Node to **22+** (`package.json` engines, `.nvmrc`, docs) and added a local preview script (`npm run dev` → `python3 -m http.server 3000`).
- **2025-12-21**: Added `.gitignore` + `README.md`.
- **2025-12-21**: Converted site scripts to **ES modules** (`type="module"`) and added shared `lib/` utilities imported by browser code + Node tests.
- **2025-12-21**: Extracted terminal path helpers (`normalizePath`, `resolvePath`) into `lib/terminalPaths.js` with tests.
- **2025-12-21**: Clarified docs: module-based site should be previewed via `npm run dev` (file:// may not work).
- **2025-12-21**: Added Cursor slash command `/track` (`.cursor/commands/track.md`) to update `CHANGELOG.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, and `STATE.md` based on the current `git diff`.

## Handoff requirements
- Add a bullet for each agent session with **date + what changed + why**.
- Update `STATE.md` when structure/commands change.
